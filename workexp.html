                    From May 2022-July 2022, I was employed as the Data Aggregation & Research Intern at Self-Help
                    Credit Union!
                    Headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, Self-Help has many branches across the nation, including
                    Jacksonville, FL, where I worked.
                    Self-Help aspires to uphold fair banking practices to its customers, and give those who are less
                    fortunate or targeted
                    by predatory lenders a fair chance at a loan.

                <h5>
                    My primary role as Data Aggregation Intern was, as expected, to collect data. Specifically, I was
                    tasked to gather data about local Jacksonville businesses as fast as possible. To do this, I
                    utilized
                    the C# language to perform both web-scraping and browser-driving. So essentially, my job was to
                    create C#
                    programs that would either analyze publicly accessible HTML and scrape its data, or drive a Chrome
                    browser
                    to download publicly accessible data for me.

                    <br><br><br>

                    In total, I gathered the data of over 180,000 local businesses by the internship's end. After this
                    data
                    was retrieved and downloaded with C# programs, it needed to be organized. I created another C#
                    program that would take the scraped/downloaded data and organize it with pre-existing data that the
                    company
                    already owned. Duplicates would be filtered out, and all available datafields would be filled in and
                    uploaded
                    to a SQL server.

                <h5>
                    Once data was gathered, organized, and uploaded to a SQL database, my job was to make this data
                    accessible
                    to company members in an intuitive form. My boss and I decided on a company-wide website for this
                    endeavor,
                    and I chose to use a Blazor Website, which combines C# and HTML with a BootStrap template.

                    <br><br><br>

                    This website was login-protected and allowed Self-Help users with access to view paginated tables of
                    all
                    companies whose info had been acquired. 10 companies would display in the table, with their name and
                    zip code
                    as a preview. The user could click an "Expand" button to view all the data-fields that had been
                    gathered.
                    Users could enter a specific page number to visit if desired, as well.

                    <br><br><br>

                    A crucial aspect of this website's design was its search functionality. Users could search by
                    company Name,
                    EIN number, and business type (such as childcare). I also implemented filtering, with a series of
                    checkboxes. Users
                    could mark checkboxes such as ZIP codes, nonprofit status whether the company had was female-owned,
                    et cetera,
                    to tailor results to what they needed.

                    From May 2021-July 2021, I worked as a Sales Associate at my local Bealls store! This meant that I
                    was responsible
                    for creating a positive shopping experience both at the checkout counter and on the store floor. I
                    used my customer
                    service prowess to assist shoppers when they needed help, and make their time at the checkout very
                    pleasant.

                    <br><br><br>

                    I also assisted in unloading items from delivery trucks, which built in be a great comradery with my
                    fellow workers,
                    and I learned how to work with many different types of people in this environment. No matter who I
                    shared a shift with,
                    we always got the job done!

                    <br><br><br>

                    My Bealls location announced their closing shortly after I started working there, so I assisted in
                    many laborious
                    closing activities such as loading metal displays onto trucks, and consoling customers who were
                    disappointed about
                    the closure. I know that being a Sales Associate is largely unrelated to by future in the Computer
                    Science industry,
                    but I am proud of my time at Bealls and I believe it solidified my hardworking spirit that persists
                    no matter the task!
